<h1>Farms</h1>
<!-- We list all the farms here -->
<!-- Note that, even though farmList is a promise, which gets resolved asynchronously, 
        we can use it in the template directly, because AngularJS is smart. -->

    <h2>{{farm.name}}</h1>
    <p><strong>Distances</strong> : <span>{{farm.distance}}</span>
